# Library-Service-Project
There is a library, where you can borrow books and pay for your borrowings using cash, depending on the days you read the book.
The problem is, that the system of tracking books, borrowings, users & payments in the library is outdated - everything is done manually and all tracking is performed on paper. There is no possibility to check the inventory of specific books in the library. Also, you are obliged to pay with cash (no credit card support). Library administration never knows, who returned the book in time, and who did not.

In this project, you will be fixing all these problems. And to do so, youâ€™ll implement an online management system for book borrowings. The system will optimize the work of library administrators and will make the service much more user-friendly.

### Functional:
* Web-based
* Manage books inventory
* Manage books borrowing
* Manage customers
* Display notifications
* Handle payments
### Non-functional:
* 5 concurrent users
* Up to 1000 books
* 50k borrowings/year
* ~30MB/year
